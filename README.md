# FireMarks

## *What's a `FireMark`?*
You probably already know what a `FireMark` is: it's a `bookmarklet`.

## *What does ***FIRE*** stand for?*
Does everything have to be a slightly pretentious acronym? Very well, then. ***FIRE*** stands for...

***F**eature-**I**nitiating **R**esource **E**xtension*

## *That's a lot of words to describe a user-added script*
Yes, it is. So don't worry about the acronym. Just call it a `FireMark`. You stopped worrying about `Ajax` ages ago, right?

## *Why do we need another name for bookmarklets?*
We don't *need* another name for `bookmarklets`. It's not the end of the world to have one though. Not least because:

  i) *Bookmarklet* isn't even the first name they went by. According to Wikipedia...
  
  ii) *Bookmarklet* feels a little bit wrong. Like it's describing something else. ... IIFE ...
  
  iii) *Bookmarklets* feel like they've fallen out of favour a little bit. The term itself seems quite old and outdated, something from the early 2000s. There's nothing wrong with applying an energetic new name to a feature which, arguably, still ought very much to be current and popular.
