# FireMarks

## *What's a `FireMark`?*
A `FireMark` is nothing new. It's simply a `bookmarklet`.

## *What sort of `bookmarklet`, though?*
*Any* sort of bookmarklet. `FireMark` === `bookmarklet`.

## *Hmm. Okay. What does* ***FIRE*** *stand for, then?*
Does everything have to be a slightly pretentious acronym? Very well, then. ***FIRE*** stands for...

***F**eature-**I**nitiating **R**esource **E**xtension*

## *That's a lot of words to describe a user-added script.*
Yeah. It is. So don't worry about the acronym. Just call it a `FireMark`. You stopped worrying about `Ajax` ages ago, right?

## *It really is just a bookmarklet? Why do we need another name for bookmarklets?*
We don't *need* another name for `bookmarklets`. It's not the end of the world to have one though. Not least because:

  i) *Bookmarklet* isn't even the first name they went by. According to Wikipedia...
  
  ii) *Bookmarklet* feels a little bit wrong. Like it's describing something else. ... IIFE ...
  
  iii) *Bookmarklets* feel like they've fallen out of favour a little bit. The term itself seems quite old and outdated, something from the early 2000s. There's nothing wrong with applying an energetic new name to a feature which, arguably, still ought very much to be current and popular.
